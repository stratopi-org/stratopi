# Parts List

- ### Weather balloon

*(TBD)* [Latex weather balloon]()

- ### Computer

[Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/). I already had an extra Raspberry Pi 3 B+ lying around so I used that. It's plenty powerful in terms of processing and memory and it's really power efficient. A newer [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) would work as well.

- ### Cameras

[RunCam 5 Orange](https://shop.runcam.com/runcam-5-orange/). Ultra-light _(56 grams)_ 4K HD camera with image stabilization. Uses a Sony IMX 377 12MP sensor and specifically built for airborne [FPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_\(radio_control\)).<br />
[TEAMGROUP microSD Card 128GB - 3 Pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WRFQYW3). microSD storage for video footage.

- ### Cellular communication / GPS

[Waveshare SIM7600A-H 4G HAT Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PLTP3M6). Provides GPS support which facilitates locating the payload after descent and communications capability using 4G wireless networking.<br />
[Simbase SIM card and connectivity](https://www.simbase.com/). Provides wireless connectivity for IOT devices using multiple mobile operators. Wireless data is VERY expensive _($0.01 per MB)_ with Simbase so optimizations and clever solutions need to be implemented in the communications application.

- ### Auxiliary location

[Apple AirTag](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/1-pack). Provides auxiliary location tracking using bluetooth and the Apple Find My network.

- ### Temperature, pressure, humidity sensor
